Need to consider hand value AND specific hands

No matter the dealer's card:

If hand value <= 8, ALWAYS HIT
If hand value >= 18 ALWAYS STAY
If hand value == 17 and you have no aces ALWAYS STAY
If A-A, ALWAYS HIT, then go on value (This is a guess, see below)

Depending on dealer's card and NO ACES:
    2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9  10 A

 9  H  D  D  D  D  H  H  H  H  H
10  D  D  D  D  D  D  D  D  H  H
11  D  D  D  D  D  D  D  D  D  H
12  H  H  S  S  S  H  H  H  H  H
13  S  S  S  S  S  H  H  H  H  H
14  (Same as 13)
15  (Same as 13)
16  (Same as 13)

With Aces (seems that you should do the below for the first card, then go based on value):

A-A  (Always hit, really fucked up, depends on third card, then on value... I think)
    -> Third Card
        -> 9 - STAY (21)
        -> 8 - STAY (20) - This is a guess. Is is better to have a 20 hand or a 10 hand?
        -> 7 - STAY (19) - This is a guess. Is is better to have a 19 hand or a  9 hand?
        -> 6 - STAY (18) - This is a guess. Is is better to have a 18 hand or a  8 hand?
        -> 5 - STAY (17) - This is a guess. Is is better to have a 17 hand or a  7 hand?
        -> 4 - HIT  (16) - ""
        -> 3 - HIT  (15) - ""
        -> 2 - HIT  (14) - ""
        -> A - HIT  (13) - ""

A-2
A-3  (Same as A-2)
A-4
A-5  (Same as A-4)
A-6
A-7
A-8
A-9  (Same as A-8)
A-10 (Same as A-8)
